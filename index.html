                <p>We're pioneering a platform to explore health and disease research through the <strong>biological virtualization</strong> of synthetic, minimal organisms. Join us in investigating life's fundamental mechanisms by running genetic instructions in a compartmentalized, host-based environment.</p>

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>CellularLayer is dedicated to creating <strong>Minimum Viable Prototypes (MVPs)</strong> of a **biological hypervisor**. By genetically engineering simplified organisms, we aim to establish a host platform capable of running isolated "guest" biological processes. Our goal is to develop an accessible framework for creating and testing hypotheses about gene function and protein interactions in a controlled, live cellular environment.</p>
                <p>Our initial MVP explorations will focus on: Virtualizing basic genetic scenarios within a minimal, synthetic organism to observe their isolated impact on fundamental cellular processes without interfering with the host's core functions.</p>
